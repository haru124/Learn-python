****Sample codes to practice python****


**Repo owner is quite familiar with cpp & c. So, there wont be comment lines added for understanding**

Python cannot be mastered as cpp or c even with months of practice, as there are multiple built in libraries and functions. There will be many areas we're not familiar with, and even a short break might make us forget them quickly.

So, even if you find python difficult to remember, it is quite ALRIGHT!!! Programming is all about your analytical skills. To develop that, basic programming languages are sufficient.
